# Changelog

## Version 0.6.0
**Updates**:
* Jupyter extension installer now installs the stable version instead of pre-release to improve stability for the first install experience.
* The Data Wrangler software requires Python 3.8 or a later version to run as older versions of Python are losing support from several open-source libraries used by Data Wrangler.
* When exporting code to a new Jupyter notebook, Data Wrangler will now carry over the compute selection. This way, a user will no longer need to manually choose the same compute a second time after exporting. Note: This change only applies to the ‚ÄúLocal Python Interpreter‚Äù connection method and is currently only available when using the preview version of the Jupyter extension for VS Code.
* Updated the example Titanic dataset to add a column that was missing.
 
**Bugfixes**:
* Fixed an issue where the tooltip for unsupported data types was pointing to the wrong element.
* Fixed an issue where an error would be thrown for the "Calculate Text Length" operation when changing targets with a custom column name set.
